The AI engineer's work in this trajectory primarily focused on robust feature implementation, UI/UX refinement, and critical security hardening. Key accomplishments included the full integration of Purpose-Driven XP Unlocks, a complete redesign of authentication pages (Login/Register) to match the book-themed UI, and the successful creation and debugging of a public About Us page. A significant portion of the work involved building the AI Memory & Suggestion Engine from the ground up, encompassing new backend models, API endpoints, and comprehensive frontend integration. Finally, the engineer meticulously addressed critical security concerns by fully securing API keys and sensitive information, ensuring the application is GitHub-ready. The approach demonstrated iterative development, systematic debugging, and responsiveness to user feedback, resulting in a functionally enriched and securely configured application.

The RightNow Legal Education Platform aims to provide accessible and engaging legal education to college students and the public. Initially built on a FastAPI, React, and MongoDB stack with user authentication, it featured a sage green, Duolingo-inspired UI. Core functionalities included a Real-Time Statute Lookup Engine with XP rewards, an AI-Powered Legal Query Assistant (OpenAI  with RAG, UPL risk flagging, AI memory), a Myth-Busting Legal Feed, Scenario-Based Legal Simulations, Community Q&A, Advanced Learning Paths with purpose-driven XP unlocks, and an in-progress Emergency SOS Feature.

The platform's design was then entirely revamped to a book-based UX with a forest green, white, and gold color scheme. New features include Visual Bookmarks, Picture Frame Scenario Practice, Margin Scribbles (legal quotes), Achievement Stickers/Wax Seals, Threaded Footnotes from Gavvy, Chapter Tabs for Navigation, Unlocking Hidden Pages, Enhanced Page Flip Animations, a Compass Rose Emergency Menu, and a User Signature Page. The goal is to create a whimsical yet wise guidebook for legal survival, fostering discovery, control, and security.

<current_work>
The AI engineer successfully completed several major development efforts within this trajectory.
The **Purpose-Driven XP Unlocks** feature was fully integrated. This involved updating the backend () to initialize regional protections data and modifying the  endpoint to serve real data. On the frontend,  was updated to consume this API, and a new  component and  were created and integrated into  and  to provide real-time unlock feedback. The routing for  was added, and a link was included in .

A significant **UI/UX overhaul for authentication pages** was completed.  and  were completely restyled to align with the forest green, white, and gold book theme, replacing previous sage green elements. A new  component was created for flexible logo integration and used in these pages.

The **About Us page** was implemented. A new  component was created, and its route () was added to  and , as well as login/register pages. Critical debugging was performed to ensure the About Us page was publicly accessible, ultimately requiring the  route to be moved outside the 's context to prevent redirection loops.

The **AI Memory & Suggestion Engine** was fully developed. This involved creating new backend models (, , , ) in . Corresponding API endpoints for tracking user interactions, storing memory context, retrieving context, and generating personalized suggestions were added to . On the frontend, new  and  components were created and deeply integrated into , along with helper functions and UI for toggling these features. React ref-related errors were identified and fixed.

Lastly, a comprehensive **security audit and fix** was performed. The OpenAI API key and JWT secret were removed from hardcoded values in  files and , ensuring they are loaded strictly from environment variables. The  file was updated to properly ignore  files,  templates were created, and detailed  documentation was added. A  script was developed and used to verify no secrets were present, confirming the project's readiness for GitHub.
